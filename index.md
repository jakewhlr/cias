# CIAS: Concussion and Impact Alert System

## Project Description
The goals of CIAS are to develop a cross-platform, helmet agnostic, reliable impact sensing and data interpretation system to be used in american football helmets. This will minimize or prevent damage from potential concussions in football players, by being able to predict a potentially harmful concussion, or to detect an occurred concussion thus preventing any further damage. The software portion will interface with a hardware system developed and provided by a group of Electrical Engineering students. The hardware will sense any significant impact in a player’s helmet, and send the data to the coach or medic’s tablet for further processing. This data will be interpreted and stored on the tablet, accessible via a GUI.
Users will be much safer by using our product. It will provide the vital intuition needed to treat potential concussions immediately rather than waiting for symptoms to get worse, increasing overall safety. This will also prevent many of the long term negative effects caused by concussions. By providing the coaches and medical staff a way to view impacts in real time this gives the people in charge a way to determine when to pull players out of games to prevent further damage.
